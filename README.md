Python API Challenge

The purpose of this excercise was to utilize APIs to analyze weather data from 500+ random countries and use that data to help automate what would be exhaustive travel destinationr research. 

Observations -

1.) As advertised, there seems to be a strong correlation with humidity and temperature when getting close to the equator.

2.) There doesn't seem to be any real correlation with wind speed and latitude, regardless of the hemisphere. 

3.) There is a strong correlation with the north and levels of humidity, whether that be humidity that you feel or the overwhelming presence of rain.
